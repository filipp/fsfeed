# Introduction #
fsfeed is a simple PHP app that turns directory paths into Atom feeds. It's useful to run it
on an insecure file server to notify users of file or folder updates. Users can also download
files from their newsreader, provided that the web server has read access to the file.

By using a combination of the path and modification time as the URN of an entry, it can mark
an updated file as new in the newsreader.

fsfeed is not and probably never will be, recursive.

# Usage #
Just copy the fsfeed folder to where your web server can run it from and rename fsfeed.db.default to fsfeed.db.
